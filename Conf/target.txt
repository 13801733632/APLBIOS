#                                               build. This line is required if and only if the current

#                                               will attempt to be built. The following line will build

#                                               One, or more, of the following, IA32, IPF, X64, EBC, ARM
#                                               or AArch64.
#                                               Multiple values can be specified on a single line, using
#                                               space charaters to separate the values.  These are used
#                                               during the parsing of a platform description file, 
#                                               restricting the build output target(s.)
#                                               The Build Target ARCH is determined by (precedence high to low):
#                                                 Command-line: -a ARCH option
#                                                 DSC file: [Defines] SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES tag
#                                               If not specified, then all valid architectures specified
#                                               in the platform file, for which tools are available, will be
#                                               built.

#  TOOL_DEFINITION_FILE  Filename  Optional   Specify the name of the filename to use for specifying
#                                             the tools to use for the build.  If not specified,
#                                             WORKSPACE/Conf/tools_def.txt will be used for the build.
TOOL_CHAIN_CONF       = Conf/tools_def.txt

#  TAGNAME               List      Optional   Specify the name(s) of the tools_def.txt TagName to use.
#                                             If not specified, all applicable TagName tools will be
#                                             used for the build.  The list uses space character separation.

#                                                 to zero, tool automatically detect number of processor
#                                                 threads. Recommend to set this value to one less than the
#                                                 number of your computer cores or CPUs. When value set to 1,
#                                                 means disable multi-thread build, value set to more than 1,
#                                                 means user specify the thread number to build. Not specify
#                                                 the default value in this file.


# BUILD_RULE_CONF  Filename Optional  Specify the file name to use for the build rules that are followed
#                                     when generating Makefiles. If not specified, the file:
